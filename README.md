## Description

Image Analyzer is a web application that allows users to upload an image's link and get details about what is in the image like if you upload an image of Vegetables it will show all the vegetables name present in the image. The project uses the Clarifai API for image recognition, Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn for component styling, and Next UI for the user interface. I will add more Features such as Video Analysis, by which we can get the detail of the video but i won't be adding this now, wil add it later this year as i have got an internship so won't be able to work on this project for a while.
